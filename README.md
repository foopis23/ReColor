# About
ReColor was made for Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2. ReColor is a platformer, puzzler where you can change the color of your cube to solve puzzles. The main mechanic is that you can Rewind through all of the colors you switched to in the current puzzle.

# Directors Notes
I built this game mostly as a solo project in my free time after work throughout the week of the Game Jam. That said, I have credit that needs/want to give:

Josh Hovis: Music and Sound Effects (along with general second opinion throughout the process).

Also a special thanks to my friends and coworkers who playtest this game. I really couldn't have done it without all of their help.

My biggest take away from this Jam is that I really want to keep working on the level and puzzle design. Everything else I got set up pretty easily, but I just struggled with puzzle design until the very end. I feel like I kind of cracked the code for what makes a fun puzzle in this game, but then it was too late. I would have also liked to explore more thematic elements in my game, but that's just a lesson for next time.

Thank you for anyone who has stopped by to play my game!
